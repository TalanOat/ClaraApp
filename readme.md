This is Clara, a modern, easy-to-use cross-platform mental health app, built in React Native. 

SUMMARY:

This project, grounded in over six months of mental health research, supports individuals facing mental health challenges while helping general users better understand their emotions.
It provides an accessible, low-cost alternative to complex, expensive apps with weak privacy protections. User data remains securely on the device, with minimal and optional use of third-party services. 
By combining language models with visualisations, it identifies meaningful patterns such as emotional triggers and highlights the connection between environment and well-being through mapping features. 
Its robust design allows for seamless integration of additional features in future updates.
